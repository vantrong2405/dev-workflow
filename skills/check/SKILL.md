# /ak:check

Apply `references/skill-quality.md`; report deterministic structure/provenance only, never semantic correctness.

Run real checker only.
Pre-ship: `--min G8`. Pre-merge: `--min G9 --strict`.
Optional `--verify-net` for CI URL HTTP check.
Nonzero exit = refuse PASS.
Validate JSON when requested, separate warnings from PASS, and route each failure to its owning
stage. Ship-final check is `--min AUDIT --strict`, not G9 alone.
