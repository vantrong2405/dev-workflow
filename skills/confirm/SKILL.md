# /ak:confirm

Apply `references/skill-quality.md`; this stage records decisions but never manufactures or reinterprets them.

If first `/ak:*` command in this workspace, ask `[LOCALE]` per `references/locale.md`
before anything else.

**Risk=P2 fast path**: G3 is soft for P2 (see `references/risk.md`) — a real human `CONFIRM G3:`
is still the safest evidence, but a genuinely tiny, non-behavioral P2 ticket may skip this stage
and go straight to `:plan`/`:build` with `check-gates.sh` only warning, not failing, at G3. Say so
explicitly once — `"Risk=P2 — CONFIRM G3 is optional here; skip it and continue, or send the
confirm line if you'd rather have it on record."` — and let the user pick. `--strict` or any risk
other than P2 always requires the full flow below.

1. Present clarify decisions + OPEN Qs + spec deltas as a short summary — what's being locked in,
   not a raw dump of `03-clarify-report.md`.
2. Hand the user a ready-to-send line instead of asking them to compose one from memory:
   `CONFIRM G3: <Ticket_ID> <your name> <YYYY-MM-DD>` — ticket and today's date already filled in,
   only the name left as a placeholder for them to edit (the AI cannot fill in the human's name
   itself — that would defeat the anti-forge point of this whole gate). P0: also hand over
   `CONFIRM G3-PM: <Ticket_ID> <your name> <YYYY-MM-DD>` for the PM to send.
3. **Simplified reply path — the user does not need to type the line back verbatim.** Any reply
   that clearly reads as agreement — a name, "ok <name>", "đồng ý, <name>" — is enough. Compose the
   exact `CONFIRM G3: <Ticket> <Name> <Date>` line from that reply and show it back once so the user
   sees exactly what gets written, then treat that shown-back line as the record once uncontested
   (same anti-forge floor, fewer keystrokes). This is a speed/safety tradeoff, not a pure convenience
   shortcut: the anti-forge floor is preserved only because the exact line is shown back and the
   user gets one chance to contest it before it's written — if that show-back step is ever skipped,
   this stops being safe. This applies whether `:confirm` was called directly
   or reached via `:start`'s step 3 — one rule, not two.
4. Write the phrase(s) to **both** `INDEX.md` and `03b-human-confirm.md` (Source: user-message).
   Never fill in or guess the name, and never silently reinterpret free text as if it were the
   phrase.
   - Reply matches `CONFIRM G3: <Ticket> <Name> <Date>` exactly → write it as-is.
   - Reply clearly reads as agreement but not in that shape (a bare name, "ok <name>", "đồng ý, tên
     tôi là Hoa") → compose the correct line from what they just gave you (their name, today's date
     if they didn't state one), show it back once, and write it once shown-back and uncontested —
     don't make them retype from scratch, and don't force a second round-trip waiting for them to
     resend the exact line. A reply that *corrects* the shown-back line is authoritative over the
     first read; re-show just the corrected line before writing.
   - Reply doesn't clearly indicate agreement at all → ask a direct yes/no, do not assume.
5. Forbidden names: AI, ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Cursor, Assistant, Bot.
6. Only then G3 PASS → `:plan`.
7. Every confirmed NO/UNCLEAR claim must show the exact selected decision, owner role, and source
   message—not a blanket phrase. Unknown authority for a Requirement change keeps G3 FAIL.
