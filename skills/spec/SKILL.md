# /ak:spec

Apply `references/skill-quality.md` and the authoritative `references/stage-contract.md`.

If first `/ak:*` command in this workspace, ask `[LOCALE]` per `references/locale.md`
before anything else.

No Ticket ID given → follow `references/task-isolation.md` "No Ticket ID given": proceed with
this stage normally; only derive an `adhoc-<slug>` worklog name once a decision actually needs
persisting, not before.

You are the BA on this ticket, not a transcriber. Read `references/ba-integrity.md` before
normalizing — it governs how skeptically you treat "current code behavior" as ground truth, how
you adapt that skepticism to this project's risk profile, and what you're actively looking for
(old-spec-vs-new-spec conflicts, documented-vs-actual mismatches, a fix that only patches the
loud symptom). Apply it now, not just when something already looks broken.

**First, classify the ticket** — Bug / New feature / Spec change / Requirement change / Refactor —
per `references/ba-integrity.md`'s "Classify the ticket first" section, and record it as `Type: …`
in **both** `02-spec.md` and the worklog `INDEX.md` (`Type:` field, next to `Risk:`) —
`INDEX.md` is what downstream stages (`:clarify` especially) actually check, so a classification
that only lives in `02-spec.md` will get missed. Each type has its own investigation strategy in
`ba-integrity.md`; use the matching one, not the bug procedure by default. A ticket mixing types →
split into separate claims per type rather than forcing one strategy over both.

**Type: Refactor short-circuits this stage's content, not its artifacts.** Per
`references/ba-integrity.md`'s "Refactor" section, state the no-behavior-change claim and confirm
test coverage in `02-spec.md`'s Intent section. Still write `02-spec.md` (G1 checks for it) with
`Type: Refactor`
selected, Risk set per `references/risk.md`, and the no-behavior-change claim + coverage
confirmation in place of Scenario AC/NEG/PERM/EDGE — there is no new AC to normalize, so the AC
section states that plainly instead of being left blank. Then hand off straight to `:build`,
skipping `:clarify`/`:confirm` (stage-contract.md's entry-point routing) — no spec delta exists
for `:clarify` to diff. If any claim in the ticket isn't provably behavior-preserving, that claim
is not Refactor — reclassify it and run this stage's full process for it.

If the ticket URL argument is a Redmine link, resolve it per `references/tracker-fetch.md` before
treating it as opaque text — read the real ticket (and its comment thread), don't ask the user to
re-paste what the tracker already has.

Normalize requirements into worklog. Attach a source/truth label to each decision-driving
requirement. Reporter wording is `DOCUMENTED`, not independently verified, unless corroborated;
analyst inference remains `INFERRED`.
Set **Risk** per `references/risk.md`.
If P0: create `02b-security.md` from template (`references/security.md`).

Also invoke the `security-review` skill against the pending/planned changes for broader
OWASP-style coverage on top of the required `02b-security.md` template above — it does not
replace the template. Fold any findings it surfaces into `02b-security.md`.
Fill Scenario AC + NEG/PERM/EDGE (+ UI if needed).

If Touches UI = Yes: fill the **QA handoff — testable oracle** table in `02-spec.md`. This
worklog does not run QA itself — that happens later, outside this pipeline, by a human tester or
a tool like `qa-intelligence`. Its only job here is to make sure whoever does QA next can design
test cases **from this file alone**, without asking the dev what a field is called or what
"success" looks like on screen. "Shows success message" is not a testable oracle; name the real
field/button label and the exact machine-checkable signal (`expected_text`,
`expected_url_includes`, `expected_result_count`, `expected_network`, or `other` with a precise
description). Screen not designed yet → mark the row `☐ TBD — confirm before :build closes`,
never leave it silently blank.

Empty knowledge → `:learning`; wrong/changed → `:coaching`.
Before PASS, verify exactly one Type per claim, exactly one Risk, every requirement has a source or
explicit `UNVERIFIED`, and every UI oracle is observable without asking the implementer.

## Standalone use — self-chain into `:clarify`

`:spec` runs standalone with no other stage's output required. Once this stage's own PASS bar
above is met, check whether any claim is ambiguous or contradicts observed running behavior. If
so, say so before continuing — e.g. `"N claim(s) need clarification — running :clarify now. Say
'stop' to hold here instead."` — then **invoke `:clarify` yourself**, so a bare
`/ak:spec <Ticket>` call leaves the ticket with both a normalized spec and its open
questions surfaced/decided, not just a spec that silently defers questions to a stage the user may
never call. This is a heads-up, not a blocking question — proceed unless the user's next message
says to stop. Skip this internal call when there is nothing ambiguous to raise — an empty claim
table doesn't need a `:clarify` run manufactured for it.
