# /ak:status

Apply `references/skill-quality.md`; status is read-only and separates structural, semantic, and human-final state.

If first `/ak:*` command in this workspace, ask `[LOCALE]` per `references/locale.md`
before anything else.

Show concise knowledge and gate progress.
Read `references/workflow.md`, `references/project-root.md`, `references/locale.md`, `references/workspace-health.md`.
Reply in user language.
Without ticket: report domain freshness (see `bin/check-workspace.sh` W0–W6 checks — plugin dir,
PROJECT.md, domain-knowledge/INDEX.md, worklogs/ layout, stray files, per-ticket INDEX.md,
marker-slug consistency) + run its summary directly, do not re-derive by hand. Also list any
`domain-knowledge/coaching-tickets/*.md` with `Status: OPEN` (id + title) so the user can see
what's waiting on an answer — these are async and don't block anything, just surface them.
With ticket: report gate state from **that** worklog INDEX only (`task-isolation.md`); lead with
the phase group from `references/workflow.md` "Phase grouping" (Spec-locked/Built/Verified/Shipped),
individual gate letters second — e.g. `Verified (G7 PASS, G8 FAIL)`, not a bare gate-letter dump.
Suggest `:clean` if G9 PASS and user wants to free memory — `:clean` only needs G9, not `:audit`.
No code changes; keep default output short.
Report G9 structural, AUDIT semantic, and human sign-off separately. Run the checker when possible;
never infer PASS from a checkbox alone. Include uncertainty and exactly one next command.

**Audit-pending nudge.** Without a ticket, also scan `worklogs/*/INDEX.md` for tickets that are
G9 PASS but have no AUDIT verdict recorded, and surface them as a one-line list (id + days since
G9) — e.g. `3 ticket(s) shipped, not yet audited: TICKET-42 (6d), TICKET-51 (1d), adhoc-foo (14d)`.
This is a visibility nudge only — never blocks, never auto-runs `:audit`, never changes any gate.
It exists because `:audit` is the one gate with no structural enforcement (`references/risk.md`'s
own timebox table already flags it as the gate most likely to get cut under deadline pressure) —
`:status` is the cheapest place to keep it visible without adding ceremony to `:ship`.

Calling this mid-pipeline (after some gates PASS, before the ticket is done) is a legitimate,
low-cost way to re-orient — not just a start/end check. `check-gates.sh --json` gives a full
G0–current PASS/FAIL snapshot plus the next command in one call, cheaper than re-deriving gate
state by hand from memory of what ran earlier in the conversation.
