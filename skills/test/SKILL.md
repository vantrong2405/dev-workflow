# /ak:test

Apply `references/skill-quality.md`; filenames and logs count only when tied to executed assertions.

If first `/ak:*` command in this workspace, ask `[LOCALE]` per `references/locale.md`
before anything else.

1. Refuse if `06-review-qa.md` still has P0/P1 Status=`OPEN` — run `/ak:fix` first.
2. Fill `06b-test-evidence.md` (output + SHA + CI URL or junit path).
3. Prefer real junit/xml path so `--strict` can parse failures=0.
4. If `Touches UI = Yes`: read `references/ui-evidence.md` before capturing any screenshot — a
   plain screenshot proves the screen loaded, not that the bug is real or the fix works. Use the
   before/after technique for a bug fix, the highlight-box technique to point at the exact element
   for anything else.
5. Run `/ak:check <Ticket> [slug] G8` (add `--strict` before merge path).
6. Zero failing tests required.

## Non-strict vs `--strict` — what actually changes

Non-strict (default): checker verifies the evidence file's *shape* — SHA present and
plausible-looking, a CI URL or junit path filled in, no failing-suite row. It does not open the
junit file or check the SHA against git.

`--strict` (required before merge): checker actually opens the junit/log file and searches for
`failures="[1-9]` / `<error`, and confirms the Commit SHA matches `git rev-parse HEAD` in this
repo right now. A stale SHA (yesterday's commit, evidence pasted from a different branch) passes
non-strict and fails `--strict` — that gap is the whole point of running `--strict` before merge
instead of trusting the non-strict pass from earlier in the loop.

Run non-strict while iterating; always run `--min G9 --strict` as the actual pre-merge gate.

## 9/10 controls

Add an executed-command ledger for every distinct command in `04-plan.md` and every PASS command in
`05-impl-log.md`: command, cwd, start/end, exit code, artifact, and covered IDs. Missing commands fail
G8 unless a confirmed supersession names the replacement. Require assertion-level evidence per AC;
suite totals alone do not prove intended behavior.
