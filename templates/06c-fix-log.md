# 06c Fix log: [Feature_Name]

- **Ticket:** [Ticket_ID]
- **Source review:** `06-review-qa.md` (Code review findings)

## Triage

For each OPEN finding from review. Status after triage: `FIX` | `SKIP` | `DEFER`.

| ID | Sev | Class | Location | Decision | Why (1 line) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R-01 | P0/P1/P2 | 500/missing/injection/case/other | path:line | FIX / SKIP / DEFER | |

### Decision rules

- **FIX** — defect real in diff; matches AC/claim/security; fix in scope of ticket.
- **SKIP** — style-only, speculative (no evidence), contradicts confirmed claim/AC, wrong for this stack/convention, or out of ticket scope.
- **DEFER** — real but P2 / follow-up ticket; note owner + ticket id if any.

**Forbid:** SKIP a P0 without PM note on INDEX.  
**Forbid:** FIX drive-by unrelated files “while here”.
