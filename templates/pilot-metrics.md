# Pilot metrics (10-ticket) — machine-scored

Store at: `workspaces/<slug>/pilot/PILOT-v0.4.md`  
Score with: `./bin/pilot-score.sh workspaces/<slug>/pilot/PILOT-v0.4.md`  
Success bar: miss-spec / reopen / escape each ≤ 50% of baseline; gate_blocks ≥ 1.

## Setup

1. Baseline = last 10 tickets before workflow.
2. Pilot = next 10 tickets with ak.
3. After each ship: add one log row; keep Scores block updated.

## Metrics

| Metric | Definition |
|---|---|
| miss-spec | Bug/rework from wrong/missing requirement |
| reopen | Reopened after done for same scope |
| escape | Defect in staging/prod after ship |
| gate-block | Checker correctly blocked a bad advance |
